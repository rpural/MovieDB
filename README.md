# MovieDB
Catalog of movies owned on DVD and Bluray.

![Alt text](screenshot.png?raw=true "Main Screen")

The program displays the list of movies, read from an Sqlite3 database, sorted by either Title, or by Book and Page numbers, refering to the location of the movie in my library. The Media column contains D for DVD, B for Bluray, 4 for 4k Bluray, 3 for 3D Bluray, and E for extras and special features.

The program uses the pyqt5 or Pyside2 libraries to build the displays.
